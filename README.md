# Flower Classification Project
The Flower Classification Project is a machine learning endeavor focused on accurately categorizing 5 types of flowers using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project integrates advanced deep learning techniques with an intuitive user interface developed using Streamlit, facilitating seamless interaction with the model.

**Dataset:**
The project leverages a meticulously curated dataset comprising high-resolution images depicting diverse species, colors, and orientations of flowers. This dataset ensures comprehensive coverage of floral diversity for robust model training.

**Convolutional Neural Networks:**
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed due to their adeptness at capturing intricate spatial features within images. The architecture of the Flower Classification Project's CNN encompasses convolutional layers followed by pooling layers to extract pertinent features from input images. Subsequent fully connected layers enable accurate classification of flowers into respective categories.

**Training with Early Stopping:**
The training process incorporates early stopping techniques to prevent overfitting and optimize model performance. Early stopping halts the training process when the model's performance on a validation set begins to degrade, thereby preventing unnecessary iterations and improving generalization.

**Streamlit User Interface:**
An intuitive graphical user interface is developed using Streamlit, a Python library renowned for building interactive web applications. The Streamlit interface facilitates seamless interaction with the model, enabling users to effortlessly upload flower images and obtain real-time predictions.
